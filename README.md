# Chessboard-Vision-Training-App_Python
My program "Chessboard Vision Training App" is intended to train underrated basic skill for each newbie chess player, namely chessboard vision - ability to visualize chessboard in mind's eye and tell what is the color of each square at the chessboard without looking at the chessboard  (for example, "e2 square is black"). This app will help millions of newbie chess players to play chess better and win more often.
